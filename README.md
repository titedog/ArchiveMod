# ArchiveMod
A custom app.asar for Ninja Kiwi's Archive Application.


## How to Install
To install ArchiveMod, you need to first locate your Ninja Kiwi Archive directory. If you installed this on steam, you can go to the steam page for the
game in your library, and right click the game. Under `Management` there is a button you need to press called `Browse Local Files`. Alternatively, you
can press the gear icon, which opens up the same context menu as right-clicking on the game in your library. (As demonstrated below)

After pressing `Browse Local Files`, you need to navigate to the `resources` folder, and open it.

You will see a folder and a file named `app.asar`, and this is the file we are going to replace. Now, navigate to the `Releases` tab on this
repository and find the latest release, and download it. After downloading, just replace the original `app.asar` with the new one you
downloaded from the latest version.

Now, when you restart the NKA app, you will notice a few changes because of ArchiveMod if it was successfully installed.
